# .pubignore
# This file tells pub.dev what NOT to include when publishing.
# By default, pub respects .gitignore, but we need to override
# to include the extension/devtools/build/ directory.

# We want to include extension/devtools/build/ in the published package
# even though it's gitignored, so we use the ! prefix to negate the ignore.
!extension/devtools/build/
